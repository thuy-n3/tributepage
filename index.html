				<p>Origin of competition - details of compeition</p>
				<p>Sixteen French pastry chefs gathered in Lyon for three intense days of mixing, piping 
					and sculpting everything from delicate chocolates to six-foot sugar sculptures 
					in hopes of being declared by President Nicolas Sarkozy one of the best. 
					This is the prestigious Meilleurs Ouvriers de France competition (Best Craftsmen in France). 
					The blue, white and red striped collar worn on the jackets of the winners is more than the 
					ultimate recognition for every pastry chef – it is a dream and an obsession.</p>

							<p>Regis Lazard</p>
							<p>Régis comes from a family of artisans. He is the grandson of a baker and son of a restaurateur, and he has a brother who is a baker and a sister who is a restaurateur. But it was during the vacations he spent in the kitchen of his uncle, a pastry chef, that he developed his passion for pastry. Early in his career, Régis worked with Franck Fresson, one of the profession's elder statesmen who inculcated in him a sense of rigor and the pursuit of perfection. He has worked for more than a decade at the Luxembourg patisserie of Gerard Cayotte, who first encouraged him to test his mettle in pastry competitions. After competing in the World Chocolate Masters and the Trophy Pascal Caffet, Régis made his first attempt at the MOF Like many who do not succeed in their first attempt, Régis made a second attempt in the competition captured by Kings of Pastry.</p>

A member of the 2005 gold-medal French team in the World Cup of Pastry, Rigollot attributes his early interest in pastry to the time he spent after school at the pastry shop where his mother worked. He received his formal training at Lenôtre, the training ground for many of France's most esteemed pastry chefs.
							At Lenôtre -- founded by the recently deceased Gaston Lenôtre, widely considered the father of modern French pastry -- Rigollot oversaw production for the firm's entremets before moving on to second one of the métier's great masters, Gérard Gautheron, MOF at Lenôtre's equally legendary school. Rigollot later worked at the Pré Catelan in Paris, where his desserts were almost as famous as the cuisine of this 3-star restaurant.</p>
