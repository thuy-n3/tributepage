                and sculpting everything from delicate chocolates to six-foot sugar sculptures 
                in hopes of being declared by President Nicolas Sarkozy one of the best. 
                This is the prestigious Meilleurs Ouvriers de France competition (Best Craftsmen in France). 
                The blue, white and red striped collar worn on the jackets of the winners is more than the 
                ultimate recognition for every pastry chef – it is a dream and an obsession.</p>
